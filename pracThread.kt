/*
* Kolutin(Thread) : Excute Runnable or Callable function. (Purpose)
- Runnable : return nothing and no exception.(Mimic of folk)
    => Like folk(), the new thread will start Runnable.
    public interface Runnable {
        public abstract void run(); ==> Runnable Main Feature
    }
- Callable : return objects and can be exceptions. (Mimic of exec)
    => Like exec(), the existing thread will excute Callable.
